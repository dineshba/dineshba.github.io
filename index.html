  In oneliner, minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally.
In kube-system namespace, we can result like below,
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o name pod/coredns-5c98db65d4-n9vvl pod/coredns-5c98db65d4-p2hk7 pod/etcd-minikube pod/kube-addon-manager-minikube pod/kube-apiserver-minikube pod/kube-controller-manager-minikube pod/kube-proxy-zkw85 pod/kube-scheduler-minikube pod/nginx-ingress-controller-657fd58d97-gp6rl pod/storage-provisioner  Whenever we create pod(rs/deployments/sts/ds), Scheduler is the one which schedules this pods into any of the available node (in minikube, there is only one). In minikube, kube-scheduler-minikube is the one who schedules.

  To check if a machine(IP) is reachable, I only used ping. If ping is not working, then I will come to a conclusion that IP is not reachable. If you are like me, please read further.
How Ping works? Ping sends the ICMP Echo to the given IP and waits for the ICMP Echo Reply. If we get the Echo Reply, then ICMP server in the given IP is able to send response to our Echo request.

  I have seen lot of people confuse between resolving dns vs reach IP. So this small blog.
Inorder to get data from any computer we need to know the address of the computer which is IP address. Let&rsquo;s say we want to get some data from google and its IP is 172.217.31.196 (currently). Its very hard to remember this IP and also they can have multiple machines(IPs) which will give the same data (horizontal scaling).

  Backbone of my website: I am using hugo to build this website. Thanks to Aswin Karthik for his blog by which I setup this website. Just write markdown files and push, and travis-ci will publish your website. So cool !!!.
There are lot of themes available here. After some search, I landed to current theme which is hyde. I really liked the theme and it saved lot of my time.

  Installation for new users $ brew install fzf $ $(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install # useful key bindings and fuzzy completion   Note: Its better to use key bindings and fuzzy completion
 Default options that I use export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --reverse --border'  My usages To Search in command history: CTRL + R
To Change directory: cd + (CTRL + T) # type cd and then press CTRL plus T or cd ** + TAB  To find and open files in vim(or any editor): vim $(fzf) vim + (CTRL + T) vim ** + TAB vim $(fzf --preview 'cat {}')   You can even search and open multiple files using tab

  exec (built-in command) We can use exec for two use cases (as far as I learned today :-P)
To create independent shell from current shell Usual way:
$ bash # created a bash shell $ #do whatever you wanted $ exit # will go back to the shell which it created  Using exec:
$ exec bash #created a bash shell and killed the current shell $ #do whatever you wanted $ exit # will not go back to the shell which it created.

  I&rsquo;m a coding freak who is always interested in solving/seeking challenging problems.
Being in Thoughtworks, I found a lot of opportunities to work in various domains, few of them being - devops tools(docker, kubernetes, terraform, etc), mobile(both iOS and Android), micro services architecture.
In all experiences on my projects, we have used a ton of open source tools and benefited a lot. After taking a lot from community I felt its only natural to give back as well.
