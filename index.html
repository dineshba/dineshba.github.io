  In order to manage multiple users in a github organization, it is best to create multiple teams with different access and add users to the necessary teams.
Example: OrgName: example Teams: # each team will have different repo access - frontend - backend - devops Members: - name: dineshba teams: devops, backend - name: another-dev teams: frontend - name: some-tech-lead teams: frontend, backend,devops  Hope the above yaml explains the concept of organization, teams and team-memberships at high level

  For more productive, it is better to reuse the commands in history. In order to do that
 Save more history Optimize the history Able to find and reuse history easily  Save more history # bashrc/zshrc/etc #### increase history size export HISTSIZE=1000000 export HISTFILESIZE=1000000 ####   Note: You can specify how big you want
 Optimize the history  Remove the duplicates in the histroy file Keeps the last entry when there is a duplicate (to maintain the order)  I wrote a simple scirpt in nim programming language for the bash_history file.

  Why I will not do git fetch or git pull ? Because I have automated it.
Highly inspired from bash-git-prompt. If you are already using it (or equivalent of it), below custom script may be useful to you.
Problem Statement:
 Whenever I jump into the git directory, I do git pull And sometimes I forget to do it which might create conflicts  So created a script, which will do git fetch

  Where is user information stored in kubernetes ? Kubernetes will not store the user details.
Then how kubernetes is able to do the Authentication ?  Using CA certificates  We can configure to use CA authority Create CA certificates with user name and sign it with kubernetes CA certificate will have the user data (not the kubernetes). Kubernetes will only validate the certificate.    Using external systems  As it is deligating this authentication to external systems, we can easily onboard users into the kubernetes.

  Problem Statement: After doing git push how many of us wanted to see the
 status of the pipeline new commits in github/gitlab ui new artifacts in the nexus repo wiki page of the git repo  To be generic, you want to open a particular url after an action. How can we achieve it easily ?
Solution: Put this openrc script file in the path (so that we can invoke this from anywhere) Eg: /usr/local/bin/openrc

  What is Cookie ? An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user&rsquo;s web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with the next request to the same server. source
 Note: It is sent to the server back by the browser by default
 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Lets say you logged into the bank website and the bank website uses cookies to store the user authentication details (say sessionId or oauth tokens)

  Lets say you corrupte your terraform state. There are multiple ways in which you can corrupte it. So I am not gonna tell how we corrupted it.
In order to fix it, 1) You have to remove unneccassary resources from the state.
terraform state rm resource.resource_id #eg: terraform state rm google_container_node_pool.node_pool #eg: terraform state rm google_container_cluster.cluster  2) You have to import the actual state into the state file (Make sure import is available for your resource)

  In oneliner, minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally.
In kube-system namespace, we can see result like below,
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system -o name -l tier=control-plane pod/etcd-minikube pod/kube-apiserver-minikube pod/kube-controller-manager-minikube pod/kube-scheduler-minikube #scheduler is running, but who scheduled ?  Whenever we create pod(rs/deployments/sts/ds), Scheduler is the one which schedules this pods into any of the available node (in minikube, there is only one). In minikube, kube-scheduler-minikube is the one who schedules.

  To check if a machine(IP) is reachable, I only used ping. If ping is not working, then I will come to a conclusion that IP is not reachable. If you are like me, please read further.
How Ping works? Ping sends the ICMP Echo to the given IP and waits for the ICMP Echo Reply. If we get the Echo Reply, then ICMP server in the given IP is able to send response to our Echo request.

  I have seen lot of people confuse between resolving dns vs reach IP. So this small blog.
Inorder to get data from any computer we need to know the address of the computer which is IP address. Let&rsquo;s say we want to get some data from google and its IP is 172.217.31.196 (currently). Its very hard to remember this IP and also they can have multiple machines(IPs) which will give the same data (horizontal scaling).

There are lot of themes available here. After some search, I landed to current theme which is hyde. I really liked the theme and it saved lot of my time.

  Installation for new users $ brew install fzf $ $(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install # useful key bindings and fuzzy completion   Note: Its better to use key bindings and fuzzy completion
 Default options that I use export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --reverse --border'  My usages To Search in command history: CTRL + R
To Change directory: cd + (CTRL + T) # type cd and then press CTRL plus T or cd ** + TAB  To find and open files in vim(or any editor): vim $(fzf) vim + (CTRL + T) vim ** + TAB vim $(fzf --preview 'cat {}')   You can even search and open multiple files using tab

  exec (built-in command) We can use exec for two use cases (as far as I learned today :-P)
To create independent shell from current shell Usual way:
$ bash # created a bash shell $ #do whatever you wanted $ exit # will go back to the shell which it created  Using exec:
$ exec bash #created a bash shell and killed the current shell $ #do whatever you wanted $ exit # will not go back to the shell which it created.

  I&rsquo;m a coding freak who is always interested in solving/seeking challenging problems.
Being in Thoughtworks, I found a lot of opportunities to work in various domains, few of them being - devops tools(docker, kubernetes, terraform, etc), mobile(both iOS and Android), micro services architecture.
In all experiences on my projects, we have used a ton of open source tools and benefited a lot. After taking a lot from community I felt its only natural to give back as well.
