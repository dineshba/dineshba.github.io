      <description>exec (buildin command) We can use exec for two use cases (as far as I learned today :-P)
To create independent shell from current shell Usual way:
$ bash # created a bash shell $ #do whatever you wanted $ exit # will go back to the shell which it created  Using exec:
$ exec bash #created a bash shell and killed the current shell $ #do whatever you wanted $ exit # will not go back to the shell which it created.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a coding freak who is always interested in solving/seeking challenging problems.
Being in Thoughtworks, I found a lot of opportunities to work in various domains, few of them being - devops tools(docker, kubernetes, terraform, etc), mobile(both iOS and Android), micro services architecture.
In all experiences on my projects, we have used a ton of open source tools and benefited a lot. After taking a lot from community I felt its only natural to give back as well.</description>
